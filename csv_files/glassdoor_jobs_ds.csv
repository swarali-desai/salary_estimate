Responsibilities for FCC Data Analysts:
Define clear, concise and detailed business requirements for FCC Data that clearly document the data elements and formats that are needed, outline detailed transformation expectations and list the critical data elements that will enable downstream processes to operate effectively
Create and maintain documentation that articulates the process by which data is extracted, transformed and loaded in FCC that can be shared and understood by others
Work with downstream FCC business process owners to constantly improve, refine and expand the datasets to improve the quality and effectiveness of those processes, as well as help them to make sense of the data, providing training where required, and derive meaningful BI / MI
Conduct detailed analysis of upstream changes that impact FCC data – for example the introduction of a new products – to ensure that requirements remain up to date and define any new ones as necessary
Identify areas of overlap or data gaps that can lead to increased value, either by eliminating redundant processes or expanding existing data models
Produce accurate and insightful dashboards and reports detailing the health, content and insights available from the data, making that actionable for stakeholders and meaningful for management decision making

Familiar with data documentation, delivery workflow and defect tracking tools – JIRA and Confluence in particular
Demonstrated experience in handling and understanding large datasets and relational databases
Experience in analytical roles with a large technical component, although not necessarily from a purely data perspective (e.g. they may have prior working knowledge of upstream or downstream processes that is relevant from a data perspective)
Evidenced ability to execute and enhance a process to maintain data transformation requirements over time and constantly seek to improve these
High quality written and verbal communication skills, with the ability to focus on multiple initiatives and data subjects (types of data or varying sources of data) at the same time
