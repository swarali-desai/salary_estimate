Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unrivaled, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take ambitious steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

You'll work together with other data engineers, analysts, project managers, and subject matter experts to deliver impactful outcomes to the organization. You'll participate in multiple concurrent high-visibility projects along with occasional ad-hoc questions from your internal customers.
We continually require modifications to the data pipeline for improvements in quality, speed, and features. In this role you'll focus on building out the future state of our data pipeline. You'll help design event collection infrastructure, build data models, and ETL processes to collect, extract, and clean the data for subsequent reporting and analysis. The target is making our data model more scalable, reliable, maintainable, and better integrated with other parts of our data ecosystem.
More about you
You've been in a data engineering role for 5+ years and have a BS degree in Engineering, Computer Science, or other technical discipline. You value high-quality work with attention to detail and have a track record of delivering both.

Data comes from a variety of sources, internal and external, and in different formats. The data that we collect in a heterogeneous and distributed storage (data lake).

For our users (employee, customer) to be productive, data needs to be accessible uniformly. While understanding the nature of the data they deal with, our users should not be held responsible for its quality. The collected data might end up containing duplicates, being outdated, and generally being corrupted in several ways; one of the jobs of a data engineer is to prevent these issues and to minimize their occurrence.

We massage data, put its pieces together to provide a different perspective, elaborate it, store it, manipulate it, and optimize its access. We are also in the process of building pipelines to make the data flow from one sector of our architecture to another. We write efficient software, maintain our clusters, optimize and advise on queries, and continuously re-evaluate our process to make it faster and more accurate. To do this, we keep the discussion open, share our findings, and hold each other accountable.

We are in the middle of a substantial transformative process. We are piecing together a data science architecture that needs to sustain tons of gigabytes of data in a dependable and distributed way so that the data is at the fingertips of its users.

About Us

Founded in 2017 and headquartered in Lower Manhattan, Accrete.AI is an artificial intelligence company that builds proprietary dynamic learning technologies called Knowledge Functions designed to boost analytical productivity. Accrete’s Knowledge Functions comprise of latent mathematical representations of tacit human knowledge that seed models that dynamically recalibrate neural architectures on the fly with minimal feedback, resolving issues related to catastrophic forgetting. As a result, Accrete’s Knowledge Functions capture and scale tacit knowledge by enabling machines to accurately understand and adapt to changing contexts. Accrete’s Knowledge Functions are powering domain specific applications that accurately filter self-promotion to identify authentically engaged users; gauge influence to predict viral potential; track the propagation of rumors; and more.

Backed in part by Dr. David Magerman, who helped found the equities trading group at the world leading quantitative hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, Accrete.AI began by building and licensing applications that would help financial analysts predict market-moving merger and acquisition rumors and transcribe and analyze scores of earnings calls simultaneously in real time with human level granularity and accuracy. Accrete has since expanded its stable of Knowledge Functions to build and license smart analytical tools across a variety of industries beyond financial services such as defense, real estate, music and collectibles.

We believe that the way humans conduct analytical work will undergo radical transformation over the next several years. Due to an explosion in digital information and cognitive limitations of the human brain, it is impossible for human analysts to capture the true complexity associated with forecasting future events using pre-defined factors. As such, we specialize in building dynamic, continuously learning models that automate complex cognitive tasks typically performed by human analysts. Our mission at Accrete.AI is to scale human expertise and compound the world's knowledge for the purpose of making accurate predictions about the real world that impact financial markets.

In addition, based in Lower Manhattan, Accrete has a majority interest in NYC based Shinrai, an AI Services subsidiary.
