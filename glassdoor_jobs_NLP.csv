About Us

Founded in 2017 and headquartered in Lower Manhattan, Accrete.AI is an artificial intelligence company that builds proprietary dynamic learning technologies called Knowledge Functions designed to boost analytical productivity. Accrete’s Knowledge Functions comprise of latent mathematical representations of tacit human knowledge that seed models that dynamically recalibrate neural architectures on the fly with minimal feedback, resolving issues related to catastrophic forgetting. As a result, Accrete’s Knowledge Functions capture and scale tacit knowledge by enabling machines to accurately understand and adapt to changing contexts. Accrete’s Knowledge Functions are powering domain specific applications that accurately filter self-promotion to identify authentically engaged users; gauge influence to predict viral potential; track the propagation of rumors; and more.

Backed in part by Dr. David Magerman, who helped found the equities trading group at the world leading quantitative hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, Accrete.AI began by building and licensing applications that would help financial analysts predict market-moving merger and acquisition rumors and transcribe and analyze scores of earnings calls simultaneously in real time with human level granularity and accuracy. Accrete has since expanded its stable of Knowledge Functions to build and license smart analytical tools across a variety of industries beyond financial services such as defense, real estate, music and collectibles.

We believe that the way humans conduct analytical work will undergo radical transformation over the next several years. Due to an explosion in digital information and cognitive limitations of the human brain, it is impossible for human analysts to capture the true complexity associated with forecasting future events using pre-defined factors. As such, we specialize in building dynamic, continuously learning models that automate complex cognitive tasks typically performed by human analysts. Our mission at Accrete.AI is to scale human expertise and compound the world's knowledge for the purpose of making accurate predictions about the real world that impact financial markets.

In addition, based in Lower Manhattan, Accrete has a majority interest in NYC based Shinrai, an AI Services subsidiary.
