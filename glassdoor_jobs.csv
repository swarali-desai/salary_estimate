"Clinton Health Access Initiative
3.5",-1,-1,"Boston, MA",Social Services,"Overview:
The Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. (CHAI) is a global health organization committed to saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, while strengthening the capabilities of governments and the private sector in those countries to create and sustain high-quality health systems that can succeed without our assistance. For more information, please visit: http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org

CHAI, in partnership with its India affiliate William J Clinton Foundation (WJCF), works in close partnership with and under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) at the Central and States’ levels on an array of high priority initiatives aimed at improving health outcomes. Currently CHAI/WJCF works across projects to expand access to quality care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis-C, tuberculosis, cancer and immunization.

Background

The world has not experienced a pandemic at the scale or pace of the current COVID-19 pandemic; the virus has ferociously attacked high- and low-income countries alike, but in so doing has exposed inequities in access to quality care within and across countries. Despite a proactive mitigation and stringent suppression strategy, the number of COVID cases in India continues to rise. While the indirect impacts of the COVID-19 on availability and utilization of routine health services cannot yet be known, lessons from previous crises suggest that service disruption and displacement will have grave impact on population health. In order to address these challenges, a robust response based on strengthened health workforce, resilient supply chains and rapid increase in diagnostic capacity is being spearheaded by the Ministry of Health and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

Program Overview

WJCF, in partnership with its affiliate CHAI, is supporting the COVID-19 response in the areas of testing policy, strengthened data and delivery systems, and development of guidelines. The programme has been supporting the ICMR in scaling up testing, providing data-driven insights to support supply chain management including forecasting and inventory management, and helping build guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for downstream distribution of commodities. Separately, the programme also supports selected states on localized strategies for testing scale up and equitable access, stronger engagement with the private sector, improved treatment readiness, robust awareness campaigns and capacity building initiatives, and analytics-based programme management.

However make no mistake, we solve very significant systems problems along the way. Our products work across our customers ecosystems to help people.

We’re very pleased to be expanding our development team. We’re a close knit group of innovators that have previously launched very successful start-ups. Our track record building successful technology businesses and reputation is helping us grow and we’re now looking to add experienced Data Science Developers to our team in Pune.

You have hands-on experience using AI frameworks such as Tensor Flow and Keras in a work setting. You have at least a couple of years of work experience using Python/R. You’ve used multiple classification models and Pandas, Numpy, Matlab etc. You are proficient at using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Random Tree, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes etc. You have a track record of demonstrated success in business problem solving. Data visualization experience is a plus.

You are the kind of developer that other developers seek out to solve their technical difficulties. You keep up to date with what’s happening in the data science world and know the differences between classification, regression, clustering and time series. You know the limitations of each algorithm. You are motivated to learn new technologies.
That’s a high level summary of what we’re looking for but before we dive into the detail, you’ll probably want to know who you are going to be working for and what your work environment will be like:

Who we are:
We are an Insurtech company with a core mission of leveraging artificial intelligence algorithms and techniques to solve complex business problems. We like to think that solving these business issues for our customers helps make them better at serving their customers. Some of our applications help people who may be injured or have been in an accident. In our opinion that’s a worthwhile pursuit. While our current business vertical is insurance, we see our technology expanding to other business verticals with time. Our founders have a solid track record of starting technology companies and making them successful.

We love what we do and not the least of which is that we have the opportunity to try out and ‘play’ with the latest advances in tools and technology.

Who you’ll be working with:
We are a collaborative, tight knit group of contributors. While we’re headquartered in the Chicago area in Lisle, our software lab is located in Pune, India. We have decades of experience working with remote teams. We’re looking to expand our Developer positions in Pune, India.

You’ll find our CTO a joy to work with; someone with excellent technical skills, always willing to mentor, roll up his sleeves and get deep into the technical issues. He possesses rare technical insight and no matter the day or time he’s always willing to contribute to move things forward. Our CEO is a rare combination of technical and business skills with remarkable vision and the ability to easily cut through the most complex issues to find the simplest answer. You’ll be working side by side with them and the rest of our technical team in what will be an amazing opportunity for you.

Your work environment:
We are a group of talented and dedicated individuals and through we are a start-up, we have a ‘no insane hours’ rule.

We are not clock watchers. If you need to take off for a couple of hours to visit the doctor or dentist go ahead. We look at what you’re accomplishing not how many hours you spend in the office. We conduct meetings on a daily basis with our Chicago office so some overlapping hours are necessary.

Our Pune office space is modest. We prefer to pay you more than prevailing market wages rather than spend money on fancy office space.

Our work is performed using the latest technology and tools. We’re constantly innovating and improving our delivery capability by building our own components and tools as well as licensing new tech that we’ve tried and works in our environment.

We are an open, collaborative work environment and suggestions are not just welcome, they are appreciated. You’ll find our product roadmap is exciting and full of opportunity.

Your skills:
You keep up with technology changes and trends

You are a top notch Developer whose code not only solves complex issues but is written in such a way that the rest of your team is able to understand. This means that you’re not shy about documenting your code and you understand the need for coding standards and why everyone should use them

You are motivated. You have amazing debugging skills and are quick at identifying and fixing bugs

You are skilled at development with Python/R and using Ai frameworks such as Tensor Flow and Keras

Proficient in the use of Pandas, Numpy, Matlib, MatPlotlib and commonly used libraries
You understand ML algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Random Tree, XgBoost etc thoroughly

About Us
Most of the world’s digital information was created in the last few years with the vast majority of that information being unstructured in the form of text, tweets, videos, images, blogs, etc. The rate of growth of digital information vastly exceeds our biological processing abilities. The consequence for investors is that it’s becoming harder to make sense of the factors that drive financial markets. Acting upon partial understanding of vast quantities of information (i.e., heuristics) infuses investment decisions with cognitive biases. In order to beat markets and make money, humans need to augment their reasoning capacity, consider the relevance of more information, and make bias-free decisions.
At Accrete.AI, our vision is to help investors generate alpha, or excess returns, by training machines to think in the language of the markets. We leverage deep learning and Machine Augmented Collective Intelligence (MACI) to train machines to reason and learn so they can help human investors make better investment decisions.

"Reverie Language Technologies
4.3",-1,2009,"BENGALURU, India",Enterprise Software & Network Solutions,"Why we exist:
The Indian internet has exploded. Over half a billion Indians will be online before the end of this year. Most of these Indians will prefer using their own language online. And next to nobody is building solutions for them. They are prevented from using the internet to its fullest potential because English forms a language barrier.

Whenever they visit a site or app, they are met with a wall of text in a language that they do not understand.

We at Reverie believe in language equality on the internet. It’s what drives us and gives what we do meaning. Language equality basically means that every Indian should enjoy the same range of options and experiences online in their own language that an English speaker does online.

What we do:
We take immense pride in the fact that we tackle some of the most complex and impactful problems Indian language users currently face today.

We’re working towards our mission of language equality by building a full-stack of language technologies and solutions, spanning fonts, font rendering, transliteration, translation, app & website localisation in real-time, Indian language input (check out our Swalekh keypad on the App Store), Indian language voice assistants, and Indic search, to empower the Indian language user and let them tap into the possibilities the internet offers them.

What we DON’T care about:
Your age, gender, where you went to college, or your academic scores.

What we DO care about:
Our mission resonates with you
